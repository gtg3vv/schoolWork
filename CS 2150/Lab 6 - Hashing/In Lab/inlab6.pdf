My implementation, while not as effective as it could be, did produce the correct output. (in a different order) My program was substantially faster with the O2 flag, and ran in almost half the time. My original implementation processed the 250x250 grid with words in 4.5 seconds. With the O2 flag, the average running time was 2.337 seconds. 
The 300x300 grid ran with an average time of 1.759 seconds. This decrease is probably due to the smaller wordlist. This suggests that the big theta is very much depended on the number of words. Big theta is rows*cols*words. The program must search each row and each column in that row, and then go through the words in the dict. The main difficulty I encountered in the lab was not counting the same word twice. The readwordintable() method would cut off a string when it hit the edge of the table, causing words on the edge to be counted for every length greater than three. Shell scripting was the toughest part of the lab. The tutorial was somewhat an overload of information and hard to follow. Shell scripts seem extremely useful, but the syntax is much more confusing than standard coding. With practice, they are not too bad.
