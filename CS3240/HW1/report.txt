1. I use the ADT  list as a container for data points.
2. I use an array list to hold all of the data points from file and an array to 
    hold k nearest neighbors and distances for each user point.
3. I found the usage of cat1/cat2 repeatedly somewhat confusing because they are
    just placeholders, but that isn't clear. I also was confused by 
    "non-decreasing" order. That would imply an infinite number of orderings.
4. I created a data point class to represent each xy pair and category. The data
    read in from the file is placed into an arraylist of data points. The distance
    to each point in arraylist is calculated for each user point entered. This 
    distance is compared to an array of k nearest neighbor distances and placed 
    into the array if necessary. The resulting array of nearest neighbors is 
    used to calculate average and classification. 
5. I created test cases for  each major step of the calculation. I tested my 
    distance function and verified that the data points were read in correctly.
    I then verified my k neighbors results with several test cases before 
    finally verifying the average  and classification were correct.
6. I did a basic test case with 10 data points  and  k = 5 to test functionality.
    I did a test case where m was smaller than the data file to make sure the file 
    was still read correctly. I also tested cases with varying numbers of cat1 and
    cat2 in the k nearest neighbors to ensure that the classification was being
    done correctly.
7. I spent about 2 hrs on this assignment.
