#Polaris Alpha Coding Challenge #2
#5/14/2017

The .py file contains my solution to the algorithm programming challenge. I commented
fairly extensively in the file to indicate what I was doing. I included the basic test 
file I was using, though it should work with any that has the right format. (ending in "0")

# Please run the program using python3 and specify the testfile as the first
# command line parameter.
# ex) python3 polaris.py polaristest.txt
