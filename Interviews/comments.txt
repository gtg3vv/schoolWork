    I implemented the scraper using csv and pythons beautifulsoup for easy html parsing.
The only problem I ran into here was finding the table in the html document because it
did not have an id or unique class. I had to hard-code the location of the table on 
this particular web page. This is also what I would change if I were to continue 
improving my scraper. I would make the scraper locate the matching table dynamically
on this page or another so that the scraper could be applied to other web pages 
without having to change hard-coded values.

    I did not use any flow diagrams, but briefly describe the algorithms in the 
associated file.

    The function E() does not satisfy the conditions to be a linear operator. It
satisfies the first two conditions, assuming that you change the data type read 
into the numpy array. If you do not, integer overflow will cause all three 
conditions to fail. Even with this change, E(aX) = aE(x) does not hold.

    It cannot because it does not maintain linearity.
    
    
    Var does not satisfy this theorem. Var is implemented using the E() described
above. The proof that var(aX + b) = a^2var(x) relies on the linearity of the 
expected value operation. If this does not hold, we cannot rely on this lemma 
when evaluating our variance. The theorem itself always holds for a random
variable X, but it assumes linearity is not broken when obtaining the expected 
value. Our implementation does not do this, so the theorem cannot be applied.
